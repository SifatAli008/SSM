# üìù Smart Shop Manager: Project Health & Gaps Report

> **Last updated: 2024-06**
> 
> This checklist is actively maintained. Some items are now complete or in progress. See below for details and next steps.

## 1. Architecture & Codebase

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- Modern MVC structure: Clear separation of models, views, controllers.
- Hybrid backend: Supports both SQL (SQLite/SQLAlchemy) and Firebase (cloud-native).
- Automated tests: 112+ tests, including robust UI automation.
- Event-driven: Real-time updates and event system.
- Comprehensive features: Inventory, sales, reporting, user management, etc.
- Good documentation: README and event system docs.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues / Gaps

#### A. Backend Consistency
- [ ] Hybrid logic: Some controllers and reports still assume SQL (tuple-based) results, while others use Firebase (object/dict). Edge cases may remain (e.g., in custom queries, exports, or rarely used reports).
- [ ] Data provider abstraction: No unified interface for switching between SQL, Firebase, or future backends.

#### B. Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Error messages: Some error logs are generic or only print to console. Consider more user-friendly error dialogs and structured logging.
- [ ] Edge case handling: Some methods (especially in reports) may not gracefully handle empty datasets, missing fields, or unexpected data types.

#### C. Testing
- [ ] Coverage: Some business logic (e.g., report generation, PDF export, bulk import) may not be fully covered.
- [ ] Mocking: Tests for Firebase logic may not use proper mocking, which can slow down tests or require live credentials.

#### D. UI/UX
- [ ] Error feedback: Some UI actions (e.g., failed report generation, failed export) may not show clear feedback to the user.
- [ ] Accessibility: No explicit mention of accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support, etc.).
- [ ] Responsiveness: Some widgets may not scale well on all screen sizes.

#### E. Documentation
- [x] API docs: No auto-generated API docs for Python modules/classes. *(README and user guide improved, but auto-generated docs still missing)*
- [x] Developer onboarding: README now includes a "Contributing" section, backend switching guide, and troubleshooting tips.

#### F. Security
- [x] Credentials: Firebase key is expected in `config/firebase_key.json`, and `.gitignore`/secrets management is now mentioned in README. *(Still, do not commit secrets in production!)*
- [ ] User auth: Passwords are hashed, but check for secure password storage and never log sensitive info.

#### G. CI/CD
- [x] CI pipeline: GitHub Actions workflows added for automated testing, building, and publishing
- [x] Deployment scripts: Added PyInstaller build configuration and PyPI publishing workflow
- [x] Automated releases: Windows executable builds on release tags
- [x] Package distribution: PyPI publishing workflow for Python package distribution

#### H. Data Migration
- [ ] No migration scripts: If you change your SQLAlchemy models, you'll need Alembic or similar for migrations.
- [ ] No data sync: No tool for syncing data between SQL and Firebase if you want to migrate users/data.

## 2. Missing or Incomplete Features
- [ ] Unified backend abstraction
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all business logic
- [x] CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and linting
- [ ] Accessibility and responsive design checks
- [x] API documentation (README and user guide improved; auto-generated docs still missing)
- [ ] Data migration and backup/restore tools for both SQL and Firebase
- [x] User/contributor documentation for onboarding and advanced usage (README improved)
- [x] Security best practices (secrets management, input validation, etc. now mentioned in README)

---

## 3. Recommendations & Checklist

### Short Term
- [ ] Add more tests for reports, exports, and error cases
- [ ] Refactor controllers to use a unified data provider interface
- [ ] Improve error dialogs and logging for user-facing actions
- [x] Add `.gitignore` for secrets and generated files (now mentioned in README)

### Medium Term
- [x] Set up CI (GitHub Actions) for tests and linting
- [ ] Add API docs and a contributing guide *(README improved; auto-generated docs still missing)*
- [ ] Implement Alembic for SQL migrations
- [ ] Add accessibility and responsive design checks

### Long Term
- [ ] Consider a plugin system for backends (SQL, Firebase, REST, etc.)
- [ ] Add data migration/sync tools
- [x] Explore packaging/distribution options (PyInstaller, etc.)
