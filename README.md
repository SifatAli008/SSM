- Removed all SQL/SQLite logic from inventory management for a fully cloud-native backend
- Unified info card backgrounds and value text for a seamless, professional look
- Inventory info cards now always show up-to-date values (never blank)
- Modernized search bar in inventory view for better usability and appearance
- Improved real-time updates for all dashboard and inventory metrics
- Enhanced UI consistency and accessibility across all views

## Technical Information

- Built with Python 3.9+ and PyQt5
- Uses Plotly for interactive charting (opens in browser)
- **Firebase Realtime Database for all inventory data operations**
- MVC architecture for clean separation of concerns
- PDF generation for reports and receipts
- Event-based communication system for real-time updates
- Performance optimization with data caching
- Comprehensive test suite

## Automated Testing & UI Test Reliability

- The test suite now includes robust UI tests for all major workflows, including inventory add/edit dialogs.
- UI tests use a `test_mode` flag and patch modal dialogs (like `ProductDialog`) to simulate user input and auto-accept, ensuring tests are reliable and deterministic.
- No production code logic is changed for testingâ€”tests patch dialogs at runtime for clean separation.
- See `tests/test_ui.py` for examples of dialog patching and best practices for PyQt5 UI automation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- PyQt5
- Plotly
- **Firebase account and configuration for Realtime Database**
- Other dependencies in requirements.txt

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SifatAli008/SSM.git
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
# Create venv (if not already present)
python -m venv venv

# Activate venv (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate venv (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure Firebase
- Set up your Firebase project and Realtime Database
- Add your Firebase configuration to the app (see `config/` or documentation)

5. Run the application
```bash
python run.py
```

### Testing
Run the automated test suite to ensure everything is working properly:
```bash
python run_tests.py
```

All UI and backend tests should pass. If you add new dialogs or UI forms, follow the same patching pattern for reliable automation.

### Troubleshooting
- If you see errors about missing packages, make sure your virtual environment is activated before running `pip install` or `python run.py`.
- If you have issues with PyQt5 on Linux, you may need to install system dependencies (see PyQt5 docs).
- For Firebase issues, ensure your configuration is correct and the Realtime Database is enabled.
